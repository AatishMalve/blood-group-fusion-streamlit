  "what is blood transfusion": "Blood transfusion is a medical procedure where blood or blood components are given to a person through a vein. It is usually done to replace blood lost during surgery, injury, or disease.",
  "types of blood groups": "The main blood groups in the ABO and Rh system are: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-. They are based on the presence or absence of A/B antigens and the Rh factor on red blood cells.",
  "difference between a+ and a- blood": "A+ and A- both have A antigen on red blood cells, but A+ has the Rh factor while A- does not. A+ can receive A+, A-, O+, O- blood, while A- can receive only A- and O- safely.",
  "what is hemoglobin": "Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and returns carbon dioxide back to the lungs.",
  "what is rh factor": "Rh factor is a protein that can be present on the surface of red blood cells. If you have it, you are Rh positive (e.g., A+, O+). If you don’t, you are Rh negative (e.g., A-, O-).",
  "what is universal donor": "O negative (O-) blood is called the universal donor for red blood cells because it usually can be given to people of any ABO and Rh blood group in emergencies.",
  "what is universal recipient": "AB positive (AB+) blood is called the universal recipient for red blood cells because people with AB+ can receive blood from any ABO and Rh group.",
  "what is plasma": "Plasma is the liquid part of blood. It is mostly water and contains proteins, hormones, nutrients, and waste products. It helps carry cells and substances around the body.",
  "what is blood smear": "A blood smear is a lab test where a drop of blood is spread on a glass slide, stained, and examined under a microscope to look at the size, shape, and number of blood cells.",
  "why is blood grouping important": "Blood grouping is important to ensure safe blood transfusions, avoid dangerous reactions, and help in pregnancy care, organ transplantation, and some medical treatments."

  "how did resnet50 perform in the experiment": "ResNet50 performed very well, achieving an accuracy of 93.27% and strong F1, precision and recall scores. It was one of the most reliable classical models.",
  "how did lenet and densenet perform": "LeNet and DenseNet121 both achieved around 89% accuracy and F1 score, performing similarly with moderate results compared to deeper models.",
  "how did resnet101 perform": "ResNet101 produced competitive results with about 91.6% accuracy, slightly lower than ResNet50 and Hybrid Fusion but still strong overall.",
  "why did resnext101 perform poorly": "ResNeXt101 underperformed with accuracy around 84%, likely because its high architectural complexity was not well-suited to the dataset size or characteristics.",
  "why did the swin transformer perform poorly": "The Swin Transformer scored very low, around 0.16 accuracy, likely due to insufficient data and because transformer-based models typically require much larger datasets to generalize well.",
  "did vit perform well in this research": "Vision Transformers performed worse than CNN models on the small fingerprint dataset because ViTs require more data for effective training and perform poorly with small-scale datasets.",
  "what are the key observations from the model comparison": "Hybrid Fusion showed the highest accuracy and general performance. ResNet50 was the strongest standalone CNN. LeNet and DenseNet121 performed moderately well. ResNeXt101 lagged. Swin Transformer performed poorly due to dataset size.",
  "how does the hybrid model compare to cnn models": "The Hybrid Fusion network outperformed all individual CNN models by combining their feature strengths and eliminating weaknesses through blended feature extraction.",
  "how does the hybrid model compare to vision transformers": "The Hybrid Fusion model significantly exceeded the performance of transformer models such as Swin and ViT, which struggle with limited datasets.",
  "how does this research compare with other papers": "Compared to prior studies reporting accuracy between 90% and 94%, the hybrid fusion model in this work achieved 95.22%, outperforming CNN and ViT models from referenced research.",
  "what accuracy did the hybrid fusion model achieve": "The Hybrid Fusion model achieved 95.22% accuracy, an F1 score of 0.952, precision of 0.9537, and recall of 0.9522.",

  "what future improvements are suggested": "Future improvements include expanding sensor types, integrating transfer learning, improving transformer performance, enabling IoT deployment, and validating the system on large-scale real-world data.",
  "what is blood group prediction": "Blood group prediction refers to the use of machine learning to infer an individual's ABO and Rh blood type from biometric features such as fingerprints.",
  "why was the hybrid fusion model best": "Because it captures both local ridge-level fingerprint features and global dermatoglyphic patterns, and merges multiple networks' strengths to improve classification robustness.",
  "why use fingerprints instead of blood sampling": "Fingerprints are non-invasive, universally accessible, easier to collect, and avoid issues associated with drawing blood such as pain, time delay, infection risk and lab dependency.",
  "what dataset was used in the research": "A specially curated fingerprint dataset with labeled ABO/Rh blood types was processed with normalization, augmentation and ridge enhancement techniques.",
  "what does accuracy mean in machine learning": "Accuracy represents the percentage of correct predictions out of total predictions, indicating how well a model performs overall.",

  "what is recall": "Recall measures how many actual positives the model correctly identified and helps evaluate false negatives.",
  "what did the conclusion say": "The conclusion states that while fingerprint-based ML prediction shows strong potential as a rapid non-invasive tool, it should complement and not replace clinical testing.",
